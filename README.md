sorry about the zip file, git was being a jerk so i just zipped it and dropped it in.

new stuff...

    gim
    gmo
    psputilsforkernel (got an update)
    usb (got an update, now includes usb mic stub and header look in samples for userspace sample)

these require decrypte the plugins to be plugged either via seplugins or by code. you can find them in the game "talkman" then remove the PSP header and decrypt the modules and plug them how you like.
