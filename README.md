## 2025 update

A whole pile of function prototypes added to headers and nids added to stub libraries. Noticed somethings that were only being linked in kernel space that are avaiable in both kernel and userspace and added the stubs to the libpspuser.a, userspace module loading works without and "pspsdk" hackery. The method for loading from userspace is the same as the sample within the kernel directory relating to module loading, just change the module attriubutes.

There have been a couple of other changes along the way trying to clean up naming convention in the headers. This part is a work in progress and is not entirely complete. You may run into issues when compiling where some cdef or macro's name is incorrect, gcc should give you the answer but you may need to check the headers too. There is a lot more information in a wide range of headers.

## Introduction

The PSP Software Development Kit (PSPSDK) is a collection of Open Source tools
and libraries written for Sony's Playstation Portable (PSP) gaming console.
It also includes documentation and other resources developers can use to write
software for the PSP.

## Features

### PSPSDK provides a full set of libraries for creating PSP software:

* Stub libraries and headers for interfacing with the PSP operating system,
  ranging from threading libraries, file io, display driver and wifi networking.
* Basic runtime support (crt0) for executables and libraries.
* A libcglue library for fulfill newlib system call requirements.
* Support code for linking with the full Standard C Library provided with the
  PSPDEV toolchain.
* An implementation of the libGU graphics library. libGU provides an interface
  to the 2D and 3D hardware acceleration features found in the PSP's Graphic
  Engine.
* An implementation of the libGUM library. libGUM provides an interface for
  manipulating matrices for use in 3D software.
* A simple audio library that can be used to play back PCM audio streams.
* Support for building static executables and PRX files (relocatable modules).

### PSPSDK also includes several tools to assist in building PSP software:

* `bin2c`, `bin2o`, and `bin2s` for converting binary files into C source, object
  files, and assembler source files, respectively.
* `mksfo` and `mksfoex` for creating PARAM.SFO files.
* `pack-pbp` and `unpack-pbp` for adding and removing files from EBOOT.PBP.
* `psp-config` for locating PSPDEV tools and libraries.
* `psp-prxgen` for converting specially made ELFs to PRX files.
* `psp-build-exports` for creating export tables
* `psp-fixup-imports` for fixing up import tables post-linking to remove unused
  functions from the executable.

Documentation for the libraries are also provided, and can be found in the
`doc/` directory of the PSPSDK source and binary distributions.

A library for Make (`build.mak`) is also included to provide an easy way to build
simple programs and libraries. See any PSPSDK sample program for details on how
`build.mak` is used.

## Installation

### Requirements

To use PSPSDK you must have the following software installed:

* [PSPDEV Toolchain](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain-allegrex)
* [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [GNU autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) and [automake](http://sourceware.org/automake/)(GNU Autotools)
* [Zlib development libraries and headers](https://www.zlib.net/)

The following packages are not required to build PSPSDK, but are used to build
documentation:

* [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl/)
* [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

### Installation from source

PSPSDK can be found in the Git repository located at
https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk. You can do the following command to download PSPSDK:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk.git
```

Once you've downloaded PSPSDK, run the following command from the pspsdk directory to
create the configure script and support files (you must have `autoconf` and
`automake` installed):

```bash
./bootstrap
```

PSPSDK uses the GNU autotools (`autoconf` and `automake`) for its build system. To
install PSPSDK, run the following commands:

```bash
./configure
make
make doxygen-doc
make install
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't installed Doxygen or don't want to build the library documentation, you can skip the `make doxygen-doc` command.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `build-and-install.sh` script for convenience.

## Notes

* This is a BETA release of PSPSDK. Some of the features and tools described
  here may not be fully implemented.

* By default PSPSDK will install into the directory where the PSPDEV toolchain
  is installed. If you decide to install PSPSDK somewhere else then you must
  define a PSPSDK environment variable that points to your alternate directory.
  The psp-config build utility will look for PSPSDK in the location specified in
  the PSPSDK environment variable first, or use its own location to determine
  where PSPSDK is installed.

* The Makefile templates provided by the sample code are designed for building a
  single executable or a library, but not both. If you plan on using these
  templates in your project to build both libraries and executables be aware
  that you will have to structure your project so that each library and
  executable are built in a seperate directory.

## Bugs

If you find a bug in PSPSDK, open an issue at https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk/issues. If possible, include any
code or documentation that can be used by the PSPSDK developers to recreate the
bug.

### Code of Conduct

We're all here to build software and have fun with our PSPs, and everyone deserves to be able to do that without fear of harassment.

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and we encourage you to contact the PSPDev Maintainers if you think something isn't right.

## Thanks

The pspsdk developers wish to thank all the people who have contributed bug
fixes, ideas and support for the project. Also big thanks to nem for kicking off
PSP development with all his work, the original imports system is based on his
work in the hello world demo.
